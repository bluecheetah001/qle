# Qube Level Editor

A basic CLI to convert between .qbl and .xml files
to poke around with how Qbeh-1: The Atlas Cube's custom levels are stored

## Usage

`qle <INPUT>`

`<INPUT>` is the name of the file to convert and must end in either .qbl or .xml.

The file will then be converted into the other format
